1. Please submit ICE by 12am Sat every week

2. only need to submit .java files, dont submit .class files

3. dont submit 1 java file with all your class files. every java file should only
have 1 class file

4. class file should only start with upper camel case. variables should start with
lower camel case.

5. make the variable name meaningful

6. if you are creating a scanner object, you can use it again and again and again. you 
dont have to create multiple scanner objects for each user input

7. if you are using a boolean variable, if it is assigned true and you want to check if it is false use ! operator.
E.g. 
boolean isSameWord = true;
while(!isSameWord) {
    // write code here that executes if isSameWord is false
}

8. use a for loop if you know the number of iterations instead of a while loop

9. switch statement variation (not tested):

public static void main (String[] args) {
    int x = 3;
    int y = switch (x) {
    case 3: yield 1;
    case 2: yield 2;
    default: yield 7;
    };
    System.out.println(y);
}

10. to find out how fast your code runs:

long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
// write code here
long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

system.out.println(end-start);

11. StringBuilder class is a mutable version of Strings. When you use StringBuilder class to create strings by appending it is faster than concatenation using the + operator

12. When you use the private keyword in front of an instance variable, you cant touch them directly so to access them you need
to create methods

13. New Line Syntax:
- /r is the carriage return for Windows
- i think there may be some differences for new line operator when using printf() in java for windows, im not really StringBuilder

14. how to create java documentation web page.
	- create a java file containing a class (E.g. human.java)
	- once you have created all the variables and methods associated with the class, run:
	javadocs -d docs Human.java 
	(i think this is the code, not 100% sure)
	
	- this will basically create a web page like how it is when u go into the java documentation and it will
	show the Human class that you created
